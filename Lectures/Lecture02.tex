\section{Lotteries, VNM utility theorem, backward induction}

\Que{When is it possible to model preferences between
lotteries using average payoffs?}
\Ans[]{When radmness is involved, i.e. when some events are called as nature ($N$) events, not in the hand of the player.}

\Que{Which utility function can we use to model a risk-
averse player? 1) \m{u(x) = x^2} or 2) \m{u(x) = log(x)}?}
\Ans[2)]{Log funct models risk-averse: he prefers lower results with higher probability.}

\Que{How can we solve a decision problem involving
sequential choices made by both a player and
Nature?}
\Ans[]{Having the decision tree, starting with nodes at the end of the tree, substitute $N$ node with expected utility and player's move with payoff of the best move.}
\Spec{\textbf{Expected utilty} is calculated as probability expected value:

\m{\EX_{x \sim p}[u(x)] = \sum_{k=1}^n p(x_k)\cdot u(x_k)} where $p$ is the payoff and $u$ is the utilty (u don't say)}
