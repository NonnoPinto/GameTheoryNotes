\Que{When a strategy is called Pareto dominated?}
\Ans[A joint strategy $s$ is Pareto-dominated]{ by another strategy
$s^{'}$ if 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \m{u_i (s^{'}) \geq u_i (s)} for each player $i$
    \item \m{u_i (s^{'}) > u_i (s)} for some player $i$
\end{itemize}
}

\Que{What is IESDS?}
\Ans[IESDS]{ stands for "iterated elimination of strictly
dominated strategies". Since a rational player will never play a Pareto-dominated strategy, with IESDS is possible to delete one Pareto-dominated strategy after the other, in order to get a set of just one strategy or at least an easier rapresentation of the game.}
