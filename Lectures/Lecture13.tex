\Que{What is a multistage game?}
\Ans[A multistage game ]{is a game which consist in a sequence of smaller games, called \textbf{stages}, where total payoff is the sum of every payoff.

Some games can have independent stages (like partial exam), other can have a discount \textbf{factor} $\delta \in [0,1]$ when stages are far apart in time. If so, the total payoff of player $i$ is \mat{u_i = u_i^{(1)} + \delta u_i^{(2)} + \delta^2 u_i^{(3)} + \dots + \delta^T u_i^{(T)} +} Discount is en exponential function of time $t$. It has to be exponential (not linear) because of time consistency.}
